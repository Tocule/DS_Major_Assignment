# DS_Major_Assignment
# Assignment till now

There are two files SCP.c and Adjusting_lists.c. SCP.c creates permutation of any string ex. Car. 1st permutation arC,2nd rCa and generates an SCP_string
i.e last column after sorting these permutations. Then it is passed to Self_Adjusting_Lists which already has predefined lists of majority of ASCII characters and by implementing MTF strategy it generates an access pattern. Also it can regenerate SCP_string by given access pattern and also this SCP_string can again be passed to SCP.c and it will recover the original string. There is no implementation of any matrix by the way. The overall goal of this assignment is to reduce or compress the characters as large as 1 GB in size. There is also 3rd program to this assignment which I will upload soon.
